# Advent of Code 2021 solutions - Ryan Paroz
## Written in Rust

I participated in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) using the Rust programming language.

Rust, as it turns out, is a very time-consuming language to write in, let alone in the month of December, so I made it to challenge 12 before calling it a year. I've still learned a lot about Rust during that time and am strongly considering doing it again in 2022!
